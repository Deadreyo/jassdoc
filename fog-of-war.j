Determines what type of fog the area is being modified to.

@param where The rect where the fog is

@param useSharedVision
Determines whether or not the fog modifier will be applied to allied players with shared vision.

@param afterUnits
Will determine whether or not units in that area will be masked by the fog. If it is set to true and the fogstate is masked, it will hide all the units in the fog modifier's radius and mask the area. If set to false, it will only mask the areas that are not visible to the units.
