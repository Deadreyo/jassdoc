/**
Returns a new rectangle as defined by two points (minX, minY) and (maxX, maxY).

The rectangle size and coordinates are limited to valid map coordinates, see
`GetWorldBounds`.

In Warcraft 3 the coordinates follow the regular cartesian system you know from
school math. The minimum coordinates (towards negative infinity) are on the left/bottom,
the maximum coordinates on right/top (towards positive infinity).

In the following graphic the N stands for the minimum point (minX, minY) and
X for the maximum point (maxX, maxY).
