/**
This returns a new image, the first ID given being 0 and then counting upwards (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

@param file
The path to the image. The image itself should have its border alpha-ed out
completely. If an invalid path is specified CreateImage returns image(-1).

@param sizeX
The x-dimensions of the image.

@param sizeY
The y-dimensions of the image.

@param sizeZ
The z-dimensions of the image.

@param posX
The x-cooridnate of where to create the image. This is the bottom left corner of the image.

@param posY
The y-cooridnate of where to create the image. This is the bottom left corner of the image.

@param posZ
The z-cooridnate of where to create the image.

@param originX
Moves the origin (bottom left corner) of the image from posX in negative X-direction.

@param originY
Moves the origin (bottom left corner) of the image from posY in negative Y-direction.

@param originZ
Moves the origin (bottom left corner) of the image from posZ in negative Z-direction.

@param imageType
Working values range from 1 to 4 (4 and 1 included).
Using 0 causes CreateImage to return image(-1). Every other value will simply
cause WC3 to not display the image.
imageTypes also influence the order in which images are drawn above one another:

| Value | Name           | Description |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 1     | Selection      | Drawn above all other imageTypes. |
| 2     | Indicator      | Drawn above imageType 4, but below 1 and 3. |
| 3     | Occlusion Mask | Drawn above imageType 4 and 2 and below imageType 1. |
| 4     | Ubersplat      | Drawn below every other type. Images of this type are additionally affected by time of day and the fog of war (only for tinting). |



Multiple images with the same type are drawn in their order of creation,
meaning that the image created first is drawn below the image created after.
